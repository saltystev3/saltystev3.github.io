        <h1>5th: Reading</h1>
        <p> Reading is the fifth thing I like doing since it introduces me into new topics or new people. My favorite genre of book is Military history since it is interesting learning how one side one or what tactics a general used to or lose. However my favorite book was not on Military it was actually a book about dogs which I read in 2nd grade (picture below)

<h2> 4th: Patch colleting </h2>
<p2> Patchs collecting is the weirdest thing I think I do since there is no real value, but I think they are intersting. I got into patch collecting in October of last year when I went to Fort Benning and went into a military surplus and got some and i've been getting them ever since I have 26 patches from different unit.
