<h5> Gaming </h5>
<p5> I game like majority of other guys. My favorite games include Hearts of Iron IV a grand strategy wargame that takes place in WWII where you pick a country and go down facism, commuinonism, or democracy and either defend yourself and allies, or take land from others and take resources.</p5>
