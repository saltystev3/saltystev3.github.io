        <h1>5th: Reading</h1>
        <p> Reading is the fifth thing I like doing since it introduces me into new topics or new people. My favorite genre of book is Military history since it is interesting learning how one side one or what tactics a general used to or lose. However my favorite book was not on Military it was actually a book about dogs which I read in 2nd grade (picture below)

<h2> 4th: Patch colleting </h2>
<p2> Patchs collecting is the weirdest thing I think I do since there is no real value, but I think they are intersting. I got into patch collecting in October of last year when I went to Fort Benning and went into a military surplus and got some and i've been getting them ever since I have 26 patches from different unit.

<h3> 3rd: Sleeping </h3>
<p3> Sleeping is the best and most refreshing thing to do whether it is a 30 minute nap or sleeping for 9 hours sleeping is the best.</p3>

<h4> 4th: Running/ Playing with my dog </h4>
<p4> I love running and playing with my dog it is one of the few things which I enjoy doing anytime of the day.
                     </p4>

<h5> Gaming </h5>
<p5> I game like majority of other guys. My favorite games include Hearts of Iron IV a grand strategy wargame that takes place in WWII where you pick a country and go down facism, commuinonism, or democracy and either defend yourself and allies, or take land from others and take resources.</p5>
