        <h1>5th: Reading</h1>
        <p> Reading is the fifth thing I like doing since it introduces me into new topics or new people. My favorite genre of book is Military history since it is interesting learning how one side one or what tactics a general used to or lose. However my favorite book was not on Military it was actually a book about dogs which I read in 2nd grade (picture below)
